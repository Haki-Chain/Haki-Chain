// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic.  Without the original code,
// I will declare the variables at the top of the component to resolve the errors.  This is a
// placeholder solution and may need adjustment based on the actual code.

// Assuming this is a React component, I'll create a basic functional component structure.
