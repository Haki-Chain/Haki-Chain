// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and'
// without declaring or importing them.  Without the original code, I can only provide
// a placeholder fix by declaring these variables.  A proper fix would involve
// identifying the correct import or logic to generate these values.

const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct initialization
const it = null // Replace null with the correct initialization
const is = null // Replace null with the correct initialization
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct initialization
const and = null // Replace null with the correct initialization

// The rest of the original src/components/common/header.tsx code would go here,
// presumably using the variables declared above.  Since the original code is
// not provided, I cannot integrate these declarations into the existing structure.
// This is a placeholder solution.
